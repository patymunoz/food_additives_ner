    "base_prompt": "Given a passage, your task is to extract entities. The output should be a valid JSON object in the following format: {\"text\": \"\", \"additive\": [], \"functional class\": []}.\nEnsure that all extracted entities are presented exactly as they appear in the text, including plurals and any other formatting.\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample 1:\n{\"text\": \"4-Hexylresorcinol, identified as E-586 in the European Union, is utilized in the food industry primarily for its preservative properties. A notable application is its ability to extend the shelf life of shrimp by reducing melanosis, commonly known as black spots. This function helps maintain the visual and textural quality of seafood during storage and transportation. Additionally, while some studies have indicated that 4-hexylresorcinol exhibits estrogenic activity similar to female sex hormones, recent research suggests it does not significantly alter estrogen receptor expression or prolactin levels in certain models. Despite these findings, its primary role within the food sector remains focused on preservation and extending product longevity.\", \"additive\": [\"4-hexylresorcinol\", \"E-586\"], \"functional class\": [\"preservative\"]}\n\nExample 2:\n{\"text\": \"Acesulfame potassium, also known as Ace K or E950 in the European Union, is a synthetic calorie-free sugar substitute widely used in the food industry. It is 200 times sweeter than sucrose and often blended with other sweeteners like sucralose or aspartame to achieve a more sucrose-like taste while masking each other's aftertaste. This artificial sweetener is stable under heat and moderately acidic or basic conditions, making it suitable for baking and products requiring long shelf life. In carbonated beverages, acesulfame potassium is typically combined with another sweetener to enhance flavor. Additionally, it finds applications in protein shakes where its smaller particle size allows for uniform mixtures with other ingredients. The acceptable daily intake of acesulfame potassium is listed as 15 mg/kg/day, ensuring its safe consumption within regulated limits.\", \"additive\": [\"acesulfame potassium\", \"ace k\", \"E950\", \"sucrose\", \"sucralose\", \"aspartame\"], \"functional class\": [\"sweetener\", \"sweeteners\",\"sugar substitute\"]}\n\nExample 3:\n{\"text\": \"Acetylated distarch adipate, identified as E1422 in the European Union, is a food additive primarily used as a thickening and bulking agent. It also functions effectively as a stabilizer. This modified starch is designed to withstand high temperatures, making it particularly useful in various food industry applications. Its ability to maintain consistency and stability under heat makes it ideal for products that require cooking or baking processes. Despite its widespread use, no acceptable daily intake for human consumption has been established.\", \"additive\": [\"acetylated distarch adipate\", \"E1422\"], \"functional class\": [\"bulking agent\", \"stabilizer\"]}\n\nHere is the passage: {i}"
